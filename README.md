### slots simulator

The slot machine is comprised of 5 slots, each with 5 different possible items.

The scripts run the machine X number of times (defined by variable j), and displays some statistics: Wins, losses, and biggest loss streak.

## Winning condition

Wins are determined based on how many of the same item show up. If you get any 3, 4, or 5 repetitions, you win. The more repetitions, the higher the prize would be.
